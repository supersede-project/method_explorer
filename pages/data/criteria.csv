Criteria,Criteria Group,Multi-select,Values,Explanation
User involvement,System Configuration,,"High, Medium, Low","Related to the participation of the user in the chunk’s activity. Relevant for activities related to feedback gathering (end-user involvement) but also for technical ones (e.g., involvement of project managers in release planning)."
Resources required,System Configuration,,"High, Medium, Low","To measure the complexity of an activity with respect to personnel, infrastructure, etc. It affects especially those activities that require some type of code development (e.g., new monitoring components)."
Project size,Functional Scope,,"Small, Medium, Large","Size of a project may impact some activities whose feasibility depends on the volume of work. A typical example would be some prioritization techniques (e.g., pair-wise comparison) that do not scale well with a large number of requirements."
Privacy,Functional Scope,,"High, Medium, Low","Data-driven methods like SUPERSEDE may be highly constrained in the case of serious privacy restrictions due to regulations, national laws, etc. Remarkably, tracing user’s behaviour may be particularly problematic (high means problematic)."
Scope,Functional Scope,X,"Single language, Multi-language, Single source, Multi-source","The scope of the project is relevant for different reasons. From the development point of view, distributed environments may challenge the mining of software repositories in order to get holistic view of the project. From the user point of view, having feedback in different languages makes it difficult to process."
Sensitivity,Functional Scope,X,Sensible,Personal data of users and any other information that can be associated to individuals are considered highly sensitive data.
Delivery strategy,Functional Scope,,"Rare, Frequent, Continuous
","The type of delivery impacts especially the later stages of evolution. Heavyweight prioritization techniques may be cumbersome to use with frequent releases, and classical release planning does not apply in continuous delivery contexts."
Technical roles,Users and Roles,X,"Analyst, Big Data Specialist, Data steward, Decision-making Supervisor, End-user","The technical roles required by the method chunk may determine the viability of their adoption. For instance, the availability of a data steward for some big data-related chunks may be critical for some organizations that lack this role."
Type of user,Users and Roles,X,"Citizen, Population segment, Technician",Some users may be more educated than others from an IT consumer perspective. It may be expected that a technician using the feedback gathering mechanisms will be more accurate than a regular citizen because s/he will have a more precise vision about the use of such feedback.
Business domain,System Landscape,,"Independent, Data-intensive
","The business domain has several consequences. For instance, a domain as smart cities is likely to produce tons of data from sensors that can be subject of accurate analysis in order to help detecting requirements for next releases."
Technologies and system architecture,System Landscape,,"Desktop, Web-based, Mobile","The type of system architecture may impact on the complexity of some artefacts to develop. For instance, a monitoring tool for a web client may require less effort to implement than the same instrument for mobile devices."
Accuracy,System Landscape,,"High, Medium, Low, N/A","Describes the fiability of the results provided by the technique in use. Some methods can provide results closer to reality than others. We may find trade-offs e.g. with resources required (one can expect that, the more resources required, the more accurate results)."
Motivation/engagement,System Landscape,,"High, Medium, Low, N/A",Some techniques can be more attractive to the users and make then these techniques easier to be adopted.
Assumptions,System Landscape,,"High, Medium, Low, N/A","Some activities require some conditions in order to be applicable in the SUPERSEDE solution. It would be nice if this assumptions are described in the activity body (or later on, when we write the text that activities need to provide to the navigation tool - see step 3 in my last email)."
