Criteria,Criteria Group,Multi-select,Values,Explanation
User involvement,System Configuration,,"High, Medium, Low","<b>What is the degree of involvement that can be expected for the SUPERSEDE users.</b>Relevant for activities related to feedback gathering (end-user involvement) but also for technical ones (e.g., involvement of project managers in release planning)."
Resources required,System Configuration,,"High, Medium, Low","<b>What is the amount of resources (in terms of personnel, infrastructure, etc.) that the company can invest in deploying, operating and maintaining SUPERSEDE.</b> It affects especially those activities that require some type of code development (e.g., new monitoring components)."
Project size,Functional Scope,,"Small, Medium, Large",<b>What type of end users can be expected to interact with the SUPERSEDE platform.</b>Some users may be more educated than others from an IT consumer perspective. It may be expected that a technician using the feedback gathering mechanisms will be more accurate than a regular citizen because s/he will have a more precise vision about the use of such feedback.
Privacy,Functional Scope,,"Strong, Fair, Not-critical","<b>What are the privacy needs to be ensured in the projects in which SUPERSEDE will be used.</b> Data-driven methods like SUPERSEDE may be highly constrained in the case of serious privacy restrictions due to regulations, national laws, etc. Remarkably, tracing userâ€™s behaviour may be particularly problematic (high means problematic)."
Scope,Functional Scope,X,"Single language, Single source","<b>What is the typical scope (in terms of language of end-users, and sources of data) in the projects in which SUPERSEDE will be used.</b>The scope of the project is relevant for different reasons. From the development point of view, distributed environments may challenge the mining of software repositories in order to get holistic view of the project. From the user point of view, having feedback in different languages makes it difficult to process."
Data-intensive domain,System Landscape,X,"Data-intensive, Not necessarily data-intensive","<b>Are the projects in which SUPERSEDE will be used generating lots of data or not. </b>For instance, a domain as smart cities is likely to produce tons of data from sensors that can be subject of accurate analysis in order to help detecting requirements for next releases."
Delivery strategy,Functional Scope,,"Rare, Frequent, Continuous
","<b>What is the usual pace of delivery for the projects in which SUPERSEDE will be used. </b>The type of delivery impacts especially the later stages of evolution. Heavyweight prioritization techniques may be cumbersome to use with frequent releases, and classical release planning does not apply in continuous delivery contexts."
Technical roles,Users and Roles,X,"Analyst, Big Data Specialist, Data steward, Decision-making Supervisor, End-user","<b>What company roles exist in the company that can be expected to be involved in the deployment, operation and maintenance of SUPERSEDE.</b> The technical roles required by the different activities may determine the viability of their adoption. For instance, the availability of a data steward for some big data-related chunks may be critical for some organizations that lack this role."
Type of user,Users and Roles,X,"Citizen, Population segment, Technician",<b>What type of end users can be expected to interact with the SUPERSEDE platform.</b> Some users may be more educated than others from an IT consumer perspective. It may be expected that a technician using the feedback gathering mechanisms will be more accurate than a regular citizen because s/he will have a more precise vision about the use of such feedback.
Business domain,System Landscape,,"Independent, Data-intensive
","<b>Are the projects in which SUPERSEDE will be used generating lots of data or not.</b> For instance, a domain as smart cities is likely to produce tons of data from sensors that can be subject of accurate analysis in order to help detecting requirements for next releases."
System architecture,System Landscape,,"Desktop, Web-based, Mobile","<b>What is the typical architecture of the projects in which SUPERSEDE will be used. </b>The type of system architecture may impact on the complexity of some artefacts to develop. For instance, a monitoring tool for a web client may require less effort to implement than the same instrument for mobile devices."
Accuracy,System Landscape,,"High, Medium, Low, N/A","<b>How critical is the accuracy of the results provided by SUPERSEDE.</b> Describes the fiability of the results provided by the technique in use. Some methods can provide results closer to reality than others. We may find trade-offs e.g. with resources required (one can expect that, the more resources required, the more accurate results)."
Motivation,System Landscape,,"High, Medium, Low, N/A",<b>How motivated can be expected SUPERSEDE users to be while using the tool.</b> Some techniques can be more attractive to the users and make then these techniques easier to be adopted.
Assumptions,System Landscape,,"High, Medium, Low, N/A","<b>To what extent SUPERSEDE will need to operate under certain assumptions that are not visible in the criteria above. </b>In case of having such assumptions, more detailed checks will be needed, i.e. the adoption of SUPERSEDE may be more challenging."
