Configuration instructions:,"The implementation is in the form of a library and a set of web services, the Project Development Team just needs to: 
1) integrate the feedback library into the Host Application, to do so, the developer inserts a few lines of code into the application code to invoke the functionalities of user feedback acquisition. As an example for a web application, the piece of code includes a few links to stylesheets and scripts, as well as a hyperlink to the feedback button. 
2) deploy the web services into a server (e.g. Tomcat).
3) For some monitoring Tools, the Project Development Team should also complete the following integration activities: the user events monitoring tool requires the integration of JavaScript code in the Host Application. The infrastructure monitoring tool requires credentials to access the server to monitor through SSH."
